B. Orac and Models
There are n models in the shop numbered from 1 to       n, with sizes s_1, s_2, s_n.
Orac will buy some of the models and will arrange them in the       order of increasing numbers (i.e. indices, but not sizes).     Orac thinks that the obtained arrangement is beatiful, if for any two adjacent       models with indices i_j and i_{j+1} (note that i_j       &lt; i_{j+1}, because Orac arranged them properly),       i_{j+1} is divisible by i_j and s_{i_j} &lt; s_{i_{j+1}}.     For example, for 6 models with sizes \{3, 6, 7, 7, 7,       7\}, he can buy models with indices 1, 2, and       6, and the obtained arrangement will be beautiful. Also,       note that the arrangement with exactly one model is also       considered beautiful.     Orac wants to know the maximum number of models that he can buy,       and he may ask you these queries many times.</div>         <div class="input-specification">     <div class="section-title">Input</div>          The first line contains one integer t\ (1 \le t\le 100):       the number of queries.     Each query contains two lines. The first line contains one       integer n\ (1\le n\le 100\,000): the number of models in the       shop, and the second line contains n integers       s_1,\dots,s_n\ (1\le s_i\le 10^9): the sizes of models.     It is guaranteed that the total sum of n is at most 100\,000.</div>         <div class="output-specification">     <div class="section-title">Output</div>          Print t lines, the i-th of them should contain the       maximum number of models that Orac can buy for the i-th query.</div>         <div class="sample-tests">     <div class="section-title">Example</div>               <div class="sample-test">       <div class="input">         <div class="title">Input</div>         <pre>
